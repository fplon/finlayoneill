  "TLDR; I build things",
  "I've designed and maintained databases, data pipelines, websites, dashboards, machine learning models, distributed apps, investment portfolios, analytical tools, and more. I've worked as a data engineer, quantitative developer, data science consultant to name a few.",
  "My professional career began in 2014 - hacking away in Excel VBA to automate spreadsheet reports. Since then, I've been exploring the bounds of what data and code can do to drive informed decision making, produce aesthetic and intuitive applications, unlock value from vast amounts of information, and optimise workflows.",
  "I'm interested in the decision making process, which has led much of my career - both in terms of the roles I've held but also the technologies and skills I've taught myself along the way.",
  "I've worked in teams of all different sizes and industries - from big corporate divisions to small start-up squads. I've been in roles where I've mentored junior team members and other roles where I've produced MI reports for C-suite executives.",
